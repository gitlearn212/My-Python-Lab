''' pyton provides two types of loops 
1 While loop
2 for loop
while loop: ==> Test the condition expression the body of the loop is executed while the condition remains true

For loop:    ==> Iterates over a sequence Body of the loop is executed each element of the sequence until the sequence is exhausted'''
''' 
While loop uses a conditional expression to controll the loop. When the condition is true, the body of the loop is executed. 
When the body is complete the began an the condition is still true, the body is executed again. The loop continues as long as the condition is true. 
When the condition is false the loop ends and the execution continuos the linis of code after the loop. 

For loop uses a sequence like iterate tuple and other collection type to controll the loop. 
The body of the loop is executed for each item in the sequence until the sequence is exhausted.

There are three additional controlls are available. They are CONTINUE, BREAK and ELSE
Continue:
The continue class used to short cut and started again as if it has reached the body of code.
Break:
The break class used to break out of the loop prematurely execution continue after the entire stucture.
Else:
The else controll is not common in other languages. The else class only ends if the loop ends normally. It will not end if break is used to end the loop
The above controlls apply for both WHILE and FOR loops
